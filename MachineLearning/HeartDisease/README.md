# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression on UCI Dataset
Logistic regression is a stastical modelling technique used for predicting binary outcomes or probabilites. It is commonly employed in various field, including healthcare
and medical research , to predict the occurance of a particular event or disease based on a set of input variables or features

In the context of heart disease prediction using logistic regression on a UCI dataset, the goal is to build a model that can predict the likehood of an individual having heart
disease based on a set of input features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. The UCI dataset refers to a specific dataset provided by the UCI Machine learning
Repository which contains relevant data for this task.

Benefits of using logistic regression for heart disease prediciton:

1. Risk assesment : Logistic regression can provide a quanitative estimate of an individual's risk of developing heart disease based on therir specific characteristic and
   medical history. This information can be valueable for patients and healthcare professionals in determininng appropriate preventive measure and treatment plans.
2. Early detection : By Analyzing the input features. logistic regression models can identify individuals who are at a higher risk of developing heart disease. This allows
   for early detection and intervention. potentially preventing the progression of the disease and improving patients outcomes.
3. Design support : Logistic regression models can serve as decision supports tools for healthcare providers. By incorprating relevant patient information. these models can
   help physicians in making informed decisions about the necessily of further diagnostic tests, referalls, or lifestyle modifications.
4. Resource optimization : By identifying individuals at a higher risk of heart disease. logistic regression models can aid in resource allocation and optimization within
   healthcare systems. This enables targeted interventions and allocation of resources to individuals who are more likely to benefit from them, thus improving the overall
   efficiency of healthcare delivery.
5. Research insights : Analyzing the logistic regression model's coefficients and statistical significannce can provide insights into the relative importance of different
   risk factors for heart diesease. This information can contribute to the understanding of the diesease's underlying mechnanism and guide further research and develpments
   of novel preventive or therapeautic strategies
