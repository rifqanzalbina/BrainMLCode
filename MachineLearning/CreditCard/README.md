# About this project
Credit Card Fraud Detectiion is about credit card transaction so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase

So  we have two file that from python and JupyTerNoteBook, I m HIghly Recommended you to using the JupyTerNoteBook because the data is so many that python can't handle it
but if something got error or bug you can check or analyze it again in python 

For the data .csv you can dowload [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I4uDT9vm-zYwwS0PicO0IAmI6q_GcKpp/view?usp=drive_link)

## Main Challanges involved in credit card fraud detection are
1. Enormous data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.
2. Imbalanced data is most of the transaction (99.8%) are not fraudelent which make it really hard for detecting the traudulent ones
3. Data availability as the data is mostly private
4. Misclassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported
5. Adaptive techniques used against the model by the scammers
