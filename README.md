# Machine-Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial inteligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicity programmed. Its is a data-driven approach where systems learn from examples or experiences to improve their performance on a specific task

## About This project
what is this project is about?
We analyze the csv file by training the machine to produce appropriate and good output or information, so this is machine learning where we have to first train the pattern we make to analyze the csv file
